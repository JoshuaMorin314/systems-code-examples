This example shows how to create a simple abstract type in C.

It is based on the simple idea of a rational number, which is represented as a numerator and denominator (long).

The rational number is always kept in a reduced form to minimize the likelihood of overflow of either the numerator or denominator.
Of course, this cannot be guaranteed without arbitrary-length integers.

This example also includes unit tests to test the various operations, including (random) property-style testing.
