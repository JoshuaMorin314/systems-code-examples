Synopsis
---------

A number of example programs to accompany https://os.cs.luc.edu, lecture notes on the Operating Systems course at Loyola University Chicago.

I'm doing some major updating to tehse examples, including merging in many additions I have made over the past 3
semesters of teaching it. Stay tuned for what (I hope) will be some great news.

Things I'm working on
----------------------

- For starters, using continuous integration to make sure our examples build properly on Linux. Students love it when code actually compiles.

- Incorporating GoogleTest as appropriate. Unit Testing is useful to computer systems!

- Having systems examples in C (with occasional C++), Java, and C#. Might add Python soon, too.

- Making sure software engineering is a part of everything we do.
